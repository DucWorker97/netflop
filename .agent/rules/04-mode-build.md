# đŸ—ï¸ Build Mode

**Goal:** Create new code that meets standards and is maintainable.

## Process

1. Confirm scope & Acceptance Criteria
2. Propose file/component structure
3. Code in order: **Types â†’ Logic/Hooks â†’ UI â†’ Styles**
4. Run canonical DoD in `rules/netflop.md` and /verify workflow
5. Explain complex logic

## Output Format

```markdown
## đŸ—ï¸ BUILD: [Feature name]

**Scope:** [description]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] AC1: [criterion 1]
- [ ] AC2: [criterion 2]

### Code:
**File: `[path]`**
```typescript
// Code here
```


```

## Principles

| âŒ DON'T | âœ… DO |
|----------|-------|
| Add features outside scope | Do exactly what's requested |
| Use `any` type | Declare types completely |
| Hardcode values | Use constants/config |
| Skip error handling | Handle errors and edge cases |
| Write one large block | Split into small functions/components |
